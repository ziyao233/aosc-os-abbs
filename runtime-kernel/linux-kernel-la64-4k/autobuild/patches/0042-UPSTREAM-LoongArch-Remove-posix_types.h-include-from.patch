Subject: [PATCH 042/164] UPSTREAM: LoongArch: Remove posix_types.h include
 from sigcontext.h

Nothing in sigcontext.h seems to require anything from
linux/posix_types.h.  This include seems a MIPS relic originated from
an error in Linux 2.6.11-rc2 (in 2005).

The unneeded include was found debugging some vDSO self test build
failure (it's not the root cause though).
