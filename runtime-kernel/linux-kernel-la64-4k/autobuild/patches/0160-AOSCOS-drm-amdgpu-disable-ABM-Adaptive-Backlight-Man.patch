Subject: [PATCH 160/164] AOSCOS: drm: amdgpu: disable ABM (Adaptive Backlight
 Management) by default

Per report from a contributor, since v6.9, ABM was set to be automatically
enabled/disabled. It may have seemed like a good idea for brighter
screens, but the brightness adjustment is quite abrupt, which is quite
bothersome.

Disable this feature by default for now.
