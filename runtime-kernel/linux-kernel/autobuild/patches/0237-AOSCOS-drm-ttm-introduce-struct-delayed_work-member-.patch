Subject: [PATCH 237/291] AOSCOS: drm: ttm: introduce struct delayed_work
 member dwork to struct ttm_device

Commit 9bff18d13473 ("drm/ttm: use per BO cleanup workers") revised the
member struct `wq' for struct `ttm_device' from type `struct delayed_work'
to `struct workqueue_struct'.

This broke the ttm_bo_{un,}lock_delayed_workqueue() functions introduced
in "AOSCOS: Revert "drm/ttm: remove ttm_bo_(un)lock_delayed_workqueue"",
as they expect a `struct delayed_work' type as the first argument - which
is now revised as `struct workqueue_struct'.

Introduce a `struct delayed_work dwork' member to fix build (but would it
still work as expected?).

Fixes: "AOSCOS: Revert "drm/ttm: remove ttm_bo_(un)lock_delayed_workqueue""
