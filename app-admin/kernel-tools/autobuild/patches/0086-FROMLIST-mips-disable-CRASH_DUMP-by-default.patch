Subject: [PATCH 086/316] FROMLIST: mips: disable CRASH_DUMP by default

On MIPS, the space of a crash dump kernel needs to be manually specified
by both the debugee and the crash dump kernel PHYSICAL_START config
option, and the default PHYSICAL_START config will make the kernel
load quite higher, which isn't acceptable when using as a daily use
kernel (and will even confuse some naive Loongson-3 bootloaders).

So I don't think a MIPS kernel should be built as a crash dump kernel by
default, therefore this patch disables selecting CRASH_DUMP by default.
